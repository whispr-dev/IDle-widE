I created this after hearing a talk between Lex Fridman and the legendary DHH. In this talk both expressed their astonishment at the concept of a code who don't know their IDE absolutely inside out - as a tool one might spend 40-60k+ hrs using across a career, the idea of not knowing it so intimately it was a part of you seems insanity. and yet, I realized, I barely use a *fraction* of the functionality of VS Code to which I think i'm so beholden. so, why not create an ide for me? one which since I create and code it form scratch and know exactly how every bit works I cant help but know absolutely inside out?

welp - this is the result:

an IDE intended to be just that, not only for me, but for anyone who uses it - edit it, customise it, add to it, strip it down - make your copy yours. it is not software but a thing to carve your personal coding tool from - a mere base starting point and nothing more. I look forward to seeing what others do with it. :)

(ide-min is v.0.0.1 -  petey's OG take. wofl-ide is v0.0.2 - claude's shot with the refactor. claude didn't touch the plugins.)

( `/retrospect/` contains some alt. junk that is relevant if you are following a sequential semi-vibe coding journey)
